# Time & Space Complexity

## What is Time complexity?

Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input.

## Why do we need it?

- To make a better program, check whether it is faster or slower or takes up more spaces or less space.

- Comparing different algos
  - ***Example:*** Suppose we have two programs with different priorities-

      - ***High priority(slow)*** : Algo A
      - ***Low priority(fast)*** : Algo B

      If we run Program A on a fast machine and Program B on a slower machine, we might mistakenly judge their priority based on how long they take to run.
     To evaluate each program properly before running them, we need to look at their time complexity.
## Types of Time Complexity:
- Big O notation
- Theta (⊖) notation
- Omega(Ω) notation
